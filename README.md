Library on RMP benchmarks

This Repository contains a library of benchmarks for the Role Mining Problem. It is subdivided into different Folders corresponding differents variants of the Role Mining Problem.

Benchmarks for the classical variants of the RMP (Basic RMP, delta-approx. RMP, Minimal Noise RMP, Edge-RMP) are found in "RMP Benchmarks". 

Benchmarks, that include business-driven aspects like the minimalization of compliance constraints or licence costs can be found in "RMP + Compliance Constraints Benchmarks" resp. "RMP + License Costs Benchmarks".

Furthermore, two real-word benchmarks, based on data data from two German enterprises, can be found in "".

The provission of further Benchmarks preferably taken from real-world use cases or covering other variants of the RMP is strongly encouraged. 
These can be submitted to:
