# RMPlib

This repository contains a library of benchmarks for the Role Mining Problem (RMP). 
 
_RMPlib_ contains synthetic and real-world benchmark instances. 

Currently a benchmark for two-level role mining is in preparation, which contains instances created from a two-level role structure. It will be available soon.   

The provision of further benchmark instances, preferably taken from real-worls use cases, or instances covering other variants of RMP is strongly encouraged.
