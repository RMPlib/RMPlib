# RMPlib

This repository contains a library of benchmarks for the Role Mining Problem (RMP). 
 
_RMPlib_ contains synthetic and real-world benchmark instances. 

The provision of further benchmark instances, preferably taken from real-worls use cases, or instances covering other variants of RMP is strongly encouraged.
