# RMPlib

This repository contains a library of benchmarks for the Role Mining Problem (RMP). 
 
_RMPlib_ contains synthetic and real-world benchmark instances fo different variants of the RMP such as
- Basic RMP
- Basic Two-level (B2L)-RMP and Constraned Two-Level (C2L)-RMP
- Dynamic RMP*
- Interactive RMP
- Multi-objective RMP including License Costs and Compliance Score  

The provision of further benchmark instances, preferably taken from real-worls use cases, or instances covering other variants of RMP is strongly encouraged.
