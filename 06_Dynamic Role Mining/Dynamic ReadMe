Interactive Role Mining Including Expert Knowledge into Evolutionary Algorithms. 
In Proceedings of the 15th International Joint Conference on Computational Intelligence (IJCCI 2023). IJCCI - ECTA 2023. INSTICC, SciTePress, pp. 151â€“162.

The paper also contains a methotology to derive similar setst of roles for the other benchmark instances available in RMPlib.
